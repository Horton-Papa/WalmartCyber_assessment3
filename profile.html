        <h2> Introduction </h2>

        <p> 
            I am currently enrolled in Hackbright's part time bootcampo for cyber security. The materials being covered are very interesting and allows me to think in
            ways that are new! I feel fortunate to be able to attend this program, and I am tryin gto make the most of the opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>Looking forward to the future!</p>

        <h2> Background </h2>

        <p>
            I have somewhat of a non-traditional path into the technology field. After high-school, I decided to work immediately, and I spent about 10 years of my life working
            in the automotive industry: first as a technician, and later on as a service advisor (the guy you go "see" when you service your car)
        </p>

        <p> 
            I really enjoyed what I did, albeit, it was extremely stressful and fast paced: angry customers, happy customers, demanding management, chill managers, etc.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, there was always something I thought to myself, "I wonder what it would be like to go to college?" So I did. I went to community college, and started
            school, with my regular 9-5. This journey was <span style="font-style: italic;"> quite </span> a ride! 
        </p>

        <p>...but that part is a story for a different day</p>

        <p> 
            Fast forward six years, an undergrad in applied math, and a MS in Statistics, I can say, now I know what it was like to go to college. 
        </p>

        <h2>What's next for me?</h2>

        <p>
            Currently I am in the Data Science field, and I am always trying to improve and explore what else is possible. Being in this bootcamp allows me to not 
            only learn new skills, but to also learn more about myself. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I would be lying if I said I know exactly where I am going, but the truth is I don't know, and that is better than I could have ever hoped for. I just enjoy 
            the challenges, try to do my best and enjoy the ride!
        </p>
